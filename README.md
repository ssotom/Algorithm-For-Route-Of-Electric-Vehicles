# Algorithm-For-Route-Of-Electric-Vehicles

In this project a program was developed for the planning of routes of electric vehicles, using different algorithms related to the theory of graphs. For this we use large data sets to check the optimization of the algorithms.
The program takes into account the capacity of the vehicle batteries and the different points that must be visited to plan the best possible routes.

This project was developed in 2018 for the course of data structures and algorithms II
